# Movie Genre Prediction

Huggingface Competition

## Objective

The goal of this competition is to design a predictive model that accurately classifies movies into their respective genres based on their titles and synopses.
The challenge lies not just in achieving high accuracy, but also in ensuring that the model is efficient and interpretable.

## Dataset
Participants will be provided with a comprehensive dataset comprising ~100,000 movies. Each entry includes the original title, the genre(s), and the synopsis of the movie.
The dataset contains a mix of both original and AI-generated titles, genres, and synopses to test the robustness of the models.
The 10 genres include action, adventure, crime, family, fantasy, horror, mystery, romance, scifi, and thriller.

## Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric will be accuracy. Teams are encouraged to strive for a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

## Submission
Participants are to develop their models, run them on the given data, and submit their predictions in a CSV format.
The CSV file should contain two columns, one for the sample ID and the other for the predicted genre.
